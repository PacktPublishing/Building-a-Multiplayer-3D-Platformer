## About the Video Course
This course is designed to take the student from a basic level of Unreal Engine 4 knowledge to being fluent and capable of navigating the Engine to build quality games using the C++ API. It is designed to be an in-depth, easy to understand guide to programming Unreal Engine 4 games using C++. Designed as a tool for learning the C++ API from the perspective of an Unreal Engine 4 developer using blueprints, we will delve into both engine specifics (UE4 Marketplace, source control, application lifecycle and data types) and game specifics (player control, enemy creation, physics, data manipulation and networking). The course will begin with the goal of familiarizing you with the UE4 C++ API and then move on to practical applications designed to take you from an empty project to a fully networked game demo. Finally, we'll delve into the UE4 graphics pipeline to utilize the powerful tools at the developer's disposal for creating visually stunning games.
